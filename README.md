This is a custom Object-Relation Mapping (ORM) created by me that converts set-based data to object-based data. 

The user gives the database name from command line and then this program will generate a folder with .java files for each table present on the database with a default constructor, mutators and accessors for each attribute and a toString() method.

<b>How to compile from command line:</b>

at the principal folder type:
> javac src/Orm.java src/MySQLDatabase.java src/DLException.java -d bin/

then go to the bin folder and type:
> java -cp .:../include/mysql-connector-java-5.1.38-bin.jar Orm name_of_database

At the bin folder you will notice a new folder with the name of your database containing classes for each table.

<b>Project structure:</b>

> bin
>> executables
>> folders generated by the program

> data
>> an .sql file with an example database

> include
>> jdbc

> log
>> log file with error report generated by the program

> src
>> .java files
